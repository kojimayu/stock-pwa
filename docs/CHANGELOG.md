# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Auto Logout**: Increased idle timeout from 5 minutes to 10 minutes. Added warning message to Kiosk login screen.
- **Session Persistence**: Checkout processes (Material & Aircon) now keep the user on the same screen instead of redirecting to a completion page, allowing for continued operation or history checking.
- **Stock Verification**: Added stock verification dialog to Material Checkout (CartSidebar) to match Aircon workflow.
- **Quantity Warning**: Added warning dialog when selecting odd quantities for paired items (e.g., cosmetic blocks).

### Fixed
- **Aircon Stock Check**: Fixed critical issue where air conditioners could be checked out even with 0 stock. Added strict server-side stock validation and detailed error messages.
- **Return Validation**: Implemented strict validation for return quantities based on previous return history, preventing excessive returns.
- **UI**: Cleaned up Kiosk headers (removed vendor name) and enhanced visibility of History buttons.
- **Admin UI**: Made admin sidebar menus collapsible for better navigation.
